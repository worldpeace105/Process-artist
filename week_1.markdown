The parts that was the most challenging for me this week was 	working with the process art project. Even though art is one of my favorite topics and something I enjoy doing, it was verty difficult figuring out how to make certain objects react or do something the way I want them to. Despite the many challenges it was very fun learing about the diferent ways of Ruby and how a program filled with many codes could make a beautiful piece of art. What was the most difficult was trying to have the patience of completing the project and not have any daubts. I didn't want to start thinking negatively on my self because I knew I would not be able to accomplish anything. I think we spent time working with process because not only is it fun to create unique and weird designs but it enables us to learn more about graphic design and how coding also allows us to create art. I honesty do not think any of these parts were simply easy because at many different level it became very difficult and required you to use your brain. I am glad nothing was too easy or just easy for me here because then I would feel like I am not learning anything and that is defintly not true. What was the most useful was when Jeff wrote down some of the codes on the whiteboard and went over the coding when we all at least tried it.
